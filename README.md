# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
- An online resource to study the prework section.
- This project was built to practice the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript taught during the prework.
- This project provides a convient, student-built resource to come back to for information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
- Throughout this process, I have learned a little bit about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I also learned how to apply what I learned on GitHub.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about their specific topic. As noted in the BLUE header, opening the Console does reveal the results of the JavaScript functions. 

Protip: Shift+Ctrl+C to open elements without using the mouse. Will need to navigate to console after, but saves mouse clicks.
